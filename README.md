# School Projects and My Brand Design Portfolio 💼

## About:
🎓 This is my first GitHub repository I made while I was in school.  Most of the folders include HTML/CSS projects from school.  
🤍 The "portfolio" folder is for Designs By Gia, my brand design business.  I designed and developed the portfolio website using HTML and CSS.
