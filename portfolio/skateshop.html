                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p> 
                    The goal of this project was to wireframe and design a 
                    website for a fictional skate shop. This project was made 
                    for F.I.R.S.T. Institute.

                <h3>Research and Specifications</h3>
                <p>
                    Since the old version of this website was based more on
                    skateboarding shops, I wanted to lean more into
                    the rollerskating side for this rework. I knew that I wanted 
                    to give this website a Y2K vibe.  So,
                    I began by researching the Y2K aesthetic and making a
                    moodboard in FigJam.

                <h3>First Draft</h3>
                <p>
                    From there, I brought my moodboard and color palette into
                    Figma and began creating the frames and wireframes.  During
                    this stage, I also created the logo. The logo from the
                    original version of this project was provided by F.I.R.S.T. 
                    Institute, so I decided to make an updated one that was a 
                    better fit for this new branding.

                    I finished up my Mi-Fi wireframes and started to search for

                <h3>Obstacles and Solutions</h3>
                <p>
                    One obstacle I faced when completing this project was
                    creating the holographic effect.  Since the technique
                    only works on a simple shape and requires increasing the
                    shape's stroke to fill in the entire space, I had to 
                    slightly adjust the style of the logo.  
                    Increasing the stroke to 
                    fill the entire planet shape caused it to lose it's shape,
                    so I couldn't make the entire logo holographic and only 
                    increased the stroke to fill half of the shape instead. 
                    By adding a smaller black planet shape in the center, I was 
                    able to cover the white space left in the middle.

                <h3>Critique and Revisions</h3>
                <p>
                    When I asked for critique on this project, it became clear 
                    that the "computer pop-up" style of the homepage was not
                    easily recognizable, as people were telling me that the
                    alignment was off.  To fix this UI issue, I added the 
                    red, yellow/gray, and green buttons as stylistic elements.

                    I spent the rest of the time working on the project, filling
                    in text, making buttons, fixing alignment, and prototyping.
