                <p> 
                    The goal of this project was to create branding and 
                    packaging for a fictional canned cocktail brand named Vibes.
                    They were looking for a visual identity that is bold,
                    punchy, and premium. They provide bar-quality drinks to
                    those who are bold enough to try something new.

                <h3>Research and Specifications</h3>
                <p>
                    I began this project by researching canned cocktail brands
                    and flavors.

                    From there, I designed the logo variations and began looking
                    for mockup templates.

                <p>
                    Once I had my logos and mockup templates, I started creating
                    a pattern that would be used on the boxes and other items.
                    I wanted to keep the patten simple, so I just used the "P"
                    from the logo. I made both black and white versions of the
                    pattern to match the logo variants.

                <h3>Obstacles and Solutions</h3>
                <p>
                    It was a challenge to keep the brand colors prominent on the 
                    cans while still using the relevent colors for each flavor. 
                    As I tried out different color combinations and designs, 
                    many of the styles I used caused the flavor colors to clash
                    with the brand colors. To fix this problem, I created a 
                    color blocked style with the logo and brand colors in the 
                    center, and the flavor colors on the rest of the can.

                <h3>Critique and Revisions</h3>
                <p>
                    When I was starting this project, I used a lot of dark
                    colors in my palette. However, as the brand became more
                    fleshed out, I realized that the darkness was overshadowing
                    the freshness and brightness of the brand. This was the 
                    point in the project where I realized I needed to add more
                    white and light green.

                <p>
                    To finalize this branding, I created mockups of all the 
                    brand assets I created and designed an Instagram post. I
                    then created a tag line for the brand and Plately was

                    The final products are branding and packaging for a fresh 
                    and modern brand that makes you feel good about mealtime. 
                    You can have great ingredients delivered straight to your 
                    door and stress-free meal prep.
