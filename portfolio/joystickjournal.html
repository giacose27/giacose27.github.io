                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p> 
                    The goal of this project was to create a gaming
                    magazine for Joystick Journal. The key achievements of
                    this project were fitting all of the text and images in as
                    well as fitting the information in the table. These were
                    also the major challenges of the project. Another major
                    challenge was Adobe removing the fonts I was using
                    halfway through the project.

                <h2>Research and Specifications</h2>
                <p>
                    This project was created in InDesign using 8 facing pages. 
                    I began by researching magazines overall and then narrowing 
                    down my search to gaming magazines. I began by making 4 
                    sketches and picking the best spreads to move forward with. 
                    I then found the images using Unsplash and built up my
                    color palette from the cover image.

                <h2>First Draft</h2>
                <p>
                    The first draft of this project was very simple. I began by 
                    bringing in the magazine text and ad I made in the 103 
                    course. I began noticing where images needed to be moved 
                    and text needed to be adjusted in order to fill the entire
                    magazine. This is also the stage where I chose the fonts 
                    and came up with a general layout. This is the part of the 
                    project where I created the parent pages and set up the 
                    folio, byline, and running headers. I also, set up my
                    character and paragraph styles.

                <h2>Work in Progress</h2>
                <p>
                    I continued to add in images and shift text to make sure 
                    the magazine was organized, easy to read, and well designed.
                    This is where I encountered my first
                    challenge: spacing all of the text out to fill
                    out the entire magazine. I decided the best
                    thing to do was to find more images to add.
