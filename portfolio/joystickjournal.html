                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p> 
                    The goal of this project was to design
                    a conceptual gaming magazine called Joystick 
                    Journal for F.I.R.S.T. Institute. The key achievements 
                    of this project were fitting 
                    all of the text and images in as well as fitting the 
                    information in the table. These were also the major 
                    challenges of the project. Another major challenge was 
                    Adobe removing the fonts I was using halfway through the 
                    project.

                <h3>Research and Specifications</h3>
                <p>
                    This project was created in InDesign using 8 facing pages. 
                    I began by researching magazines overall and then narrowing 
                    down my search to gaming magazines. I began by making 4 
                    sketches and picking the best spreads to move forward with. 
                    I then found the images using Unsplash and built up my
                    color palette from the cover image.

                <h3>First Draft</h3>
                <p>
                    The first draft of this project was very simple. I began by 
                    bringing in the magazine text and ad I made in the 103 
                    course. I began noticing where images needed to be moved 
                    and text needed to be adjusted in order to fill the entire
                    magazine. This is also the stage where I chose the fonts 
                    and came up with a general layout. This is the part of the 
                    project where I created the parent pages and set up the 
                    folio, byline, and running headers. I also, set up my
                    character and paragraph styles.

            <div id="jjworkinprogress">
                <h3>Work in Progress</h3>
                <p>
                    I continued to add in images and shift text to make sure 
                    the magazine was organized, easy to read, and well designed.
                    This is where I encountered my first challenge: spacing all 
                    of the text out to fill out the entire magazine. I decided 
                    the best thing to do was to find more images to add.

                <h3>Obstacles and Solutions</h3>
                <p>
                    There were two major challenges during this
                    project. The first was choosing new fonts for the magazine
                    halfway through the project after Adobe removed the
                    original ones I chose. Luckly, I frequently search for new
                    Google and Adobe fonts that I think could be used in future
                    projects, so I always have plenty on my computer. This
                    saved me a lot of time searching for new fonts to
                    download. I was able to quickly update the paragraph and
                    character styles and apply the new fonts to the entire
                    magazine.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The second challenge was fitting the data into the
                    table in a way that is well designed and easy to read. I
                    overcame this by changing the font sizes, alignment, and
                    individually adjust the tracking and leading for each data
                    point and header.

            <div id="jjrevisions">
                <h3>Critique and Revisions</h3>
                <p>
                    The critique I received pointed out that my article parts,
                    the kickers, pull-quotes, etc., were missing. For my
                    revisions, I quickly added those style elements in and
                    saved them as their own paragraph styles.

                <h3>Next Steps</h3>
                <p>
                    To finalize this magazine, I created a print
                    version and a web interactive version. In
                    includes 2 articles, a data table and 14 images.

                    The final product is an 8 page magazine with both a print
                    and web interactive version.
