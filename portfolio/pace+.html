                    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                    <p> 
                        The goal of this project was to create branding and 
                        packaging for Pace+. Pace+ is a fictional skincare brand 
                        made for athletes to protect their skin during workouts and 
                        active days. They wanted a brand identity that clean, 
                        modern, and active.

                <h3>Research and Specifications</h3>
                <p>
                    For this project, I researched different athletic skincare 
                    brands. I found that they all had different looks and vibes 
                    but none of them looked like athletic brands.  I decided 
                    that I would design Pace+ to stand out as an brand for 
                    athletes.

                <h3>First Draft</h3>
                <p>
                    From there, I started creating the color palette for Pace+.  
                    I decided to use mostly neutrals with pops of blue and 
                    orange to really lean into the clean athletic vibe of this 
                    brand.

                <p>
                    When choosing the font for the logo, I looked for something 
                    that was clean, bold, and italicized.  I decided to add both
                    the blue and orange to the plus sign to add visual intrigue 
                    and make good use of the color palette.

                <h3>Obstacles and Solutions</h3>
                <p>
                    The most difficult part of this project was designing the 
                    layout for the product labels.  Designing a brand that is 
                    clean and minimal that still stands out on a shelf can be 
                    tricky.  To overcome this challenge, I used simple imagery 
                    that adds visual interest while reinforcing the clean and 
                    athletic look.

                <h3>Critique and Revisions</h3>
                <p>
                    Originally, the back of the bottles were plain with the 
                    exception of the text.  To make the design look more 
                    complete, I added a low opacity logo pattern in the 
                    background.

                <p>
                    When I made the mockups, I decided to create another pattern 
                    with both the blue and orange plus signs to be used as a 
                    transparent packaging tape design.

                   The final products include four product label designs, two 
                   logos, and one box and packaging tape design.
