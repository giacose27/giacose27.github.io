                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p> 
                    The goal of this project was to create branding and a menu
                    card for a fictional all-day breakfast club called Daily 
                    Yolk.

                <p>
                    I began this project by researching breakfast clubs and
                    menu cards. Then, I chose the fonts, colors, and designed
                    the logo.

                    From there, I branched out and created a small coffee menu 
                    tent design for the tables.

                    I started looking for the mockups that I would use for the 
                    coffee cups and menus. During this process I found more
                    ideas for brand assets I could create.

                <h3>Obstacles and Solutions</h3>
                <p>
                    There were two major challenges during this
                    project. The first was choosing new fonts for the magazine
                    halfway through the project after Adobe removed the
                    original ones I chose. Luckly, I frequently search for new
                    Google and Adobe fonts that I think could be used in future
                    projects, so I always have plenty on my computer. This
                    saved me a lot of time searching for new fonts to
                    download. I was able to quickly update the paragraph and
                    character styles and apply the new fonts to the entire
                    magazine.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The second challenge was fitting the data into the
                    table in a way that is well designed and easy to read. I
                    overcame this by changing the font sizes, alignment, and
                    individually adjust the tracking and leading for each data
                    point and header.

            <div id="dyrevisions">
                <h3>Critique and Revisions</h3>
                <p>
                    The critique I received pointed out that my article parts,
                    the kickers, pull-quotes, etc., were missing. For my
                    revisions, I quickly added those style elements in and
                    saved them as their own paragraph styles.

                <p>
                    To finalize this magazine, I created a print
                    version and a web interactive version. In
                    includes 2 articles, a data table and 14 images.

                <h3>Final Product and Mockups</h3>
                <p>
                    The final product is an 8 page magazine with both a print
                    and web interactive version.
