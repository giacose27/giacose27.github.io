                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p> 
                    The goal of this project was to create branding and 
                    packaging for a fictional meal subscription service called 
                    Plately. They were looking for a brand identity that is 
                    fresh, modern, reliable and flavorful.  Their mission is to
                    bring fresh ingredients to your door to keep meal prep
                    stress-free.

                <h3>Research and Specifications</h3>
                <p>
                    I began this project by researching various meal 
                    subscription services. I began thinking about the colors and 
                    font styles I would be using.

                <h3>First Draft</h3>
                <p>
                    From there, I designed the logo variations and made a quick 
                    mockup of the logo.  During this stage I also began
                    searching for mockup templates and downloading the ones I 
                    would be using. I like to have at least four mockups for 
                    each project.

                <h3>Work in Progress</h3>
                <p>
                    Once I had my logos and mockup templates, I started creating
                    a pattern that would be used on the boxes and other items.
                    I wanted to keep the patten simple, so I just used the "P"
                    from the logo. I made both black and white versions of the
                    pattern to match the logo variants.

                <h3>Obstacles and Solutions</h3>
                <p>
                    The most difficult part of this project was designing the 
                    brand to feel fresh and different without straying from the 
                    prompt. This was especially tricky with the color palette. 
                    I was able to overcome this problem by using a lot 
                    of white in the design to offset the bright and dark colors
                    in the palette.

                <h3>Critique and Revisions</h3>
                <p>
                    When I asked for critique on this project, it was 
                    recommended that I make the words in the menu subheaders
                    detached and fluid, with an egg yolk background. I
                    implemented those ideas and made alternating egg yolk and 
                    maple syrup styles.

                <h3>Next Steps</h3>
                <p>
                    To finalize this branding, I created mockups of all the 
                    brand assets I created and designed an Instagram post.

                <h3>Final Product and Mockups</h3>
                <p>
                    The final product is a fun, modern brand that includes
                    various logo styles, coffee cup designs, a large menu 
                    and mini cafe tabletop menu! The logo designs have many
                    uses, with just one example being a paper holder for a
                    coffee cup.
