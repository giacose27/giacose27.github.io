                    <b>A cinnamon roll</b> (also known as cinnamon bun, 
                    cinnamon swirl, cinnamon Danish and cinnamon snail) is a 
                    sweet roll commonly served in Northern Europe (mainly in 
                    Nordic countries, but also in Austria, Estonia, 
                    The Netherlands and Germany) and North America. 
                    In Denmark it is known as kanelsnegl, in Sweden it is 
                    called kanelbulle, in Norway it is known as kanelbolle, 
                    skillingsbolle, kanelsnurr, or kanel i svingene, in Finland 
                    it is known as korvapuusti, in Iceland it is known as 
                    kanilsnúður, and in Estonia it is known as kaneelirull.
                    <sup>[1][2][3]</sup> In Austria and 
                    Germany, it is called Zimtschnecke. 
                    In Slovakia and the Czech Republic, it is called škoricové 
                    slimáky/skořicoví šneci (meaning 'cinnamon snails').

                    A cinnamon roll consists of a rolled sheet of 
                    yeast-leavened dough onto which a cinnamon and sugar 
                    mixture (and brown sugar, raisins or other ingredients in 
                    some cases) is sprinkled over a thin coat of butter. The 
                    dough is then rolled, cut into individual portions and 
                    baked. The deep fried version is cinnamon roll or cinnamon 
                    bun doughnut. Its main ingredients are flour, cinnamon, 
                    sugar, and butter, which provide a robust and sweet flavor.

                <h3 id="origins">Origins</h3>
                <p>
                    Roman spice traders introduced the Sri Lankan cinnamon 
                    spice to Europe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The spice later began to be used in Swedish pastries, with 
                    the modern kanelbulle (lit. ''cinnamon bun'') being created 
                    after the first world war. Since 1999,<sup>[4][5]</sup> 
                    October 4 has been promoted as Cinnamon Roll Day 
                    (Kanelbullens dag), a national theme day, acknowledged by a 
                    significant portion of the Swedish population. 
                    <sup>[6][7]</sup> Swedish kanelbulle dough 
                    typically also contains cardamom (powder or buds), giving 
                    it a distinctive flavour.

                <h4 id="size">Size</h4>
                <p>
                    The size of a cinnamon roll varies from place to place,
                    but many vendors supply a smaller size about 5 centimeters 
                    (2.0 in) in diameter and a larger size about 10 cm 
                    (3.9 in) to a side. The larger variety can be found in 
                    Finland, called korvapuusti (lit. 'a 'cuff on the ear'', 
                    fig. "pulling someone's ear for disciplining"), where 
                    it can be up to 20 cm (7.9 in) in diameter and weigh up 
                    to 200 g (7.1 oz).<sup>[8]</sup>

                    Haga, a district in Gothenburg, Sweden, is well known for 
                    its very large cinnamon rolls. These cinnamon rolls are 
                    called hagabullar or Queen of the Kitchen. Hagabullar are 
                    usually 30 centimeters (12 in) or more in diameter and are, 
                    despite their size, not considered a communal roll.

                <p>
                    In Sweden and Finland, cinnamon rolls are traditionally 
                    enjoyed during a get-together, including the consumption of 
                    coffee and or baked goods. In Sweden, the get-together is 
                    known as a fika, typically held in the afternoon, by 
                    coworkers during a break, by friends or by family. National 
                    Cinnamon Bun Day (Kanelbullens dag) is observed on October 
                    4 in Sweden and Finland.<sup>[15]</sup>

                <h4 id="denmark">Denmark</h4>
                <p>
                    In Denmark, cinnamon buns are especially popular on 
                    Wednesdays, where an extra large variant called the 
                    Wednesday snail is sold. This tradition was specially 
                    invented during the 1990s[16] where the national football 
                    team usually played their games on Wednesdays.

                <p>
                    In North America, it is commonly eaten for breakfast or 
                    dessert. When eaten for breakfast in the U.S., it may be 
                    served with cream cheese frosting.<sup>[17]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cinnamon buns are particularly popular during the 
                    Christmas season in both Slovakia and the Czech Republic. 
                    They form part of the traditional Christmas baking 
                    repertoire in many households, alongside other festive 
                    treats like vanilla crescents (vanilkové rožteky) and 
                    linzer cookies.
