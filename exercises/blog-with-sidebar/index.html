                <p>
                    The Villarreal Vélez sisters were raised in Monterrey, 
                    and all received training on piano and various instruments 
                    at an early age. Their parents' passion and their playing 
                    the video game Rock Band led the sisters to rock music. 
                    Following the first Rock Band jams, Daniela and Paulina 
                    selected guitar and drums as their primary instruments, 
                    respectively. After the youngest of the three, Alejandra, 
                    selected bass guitar as her primary instrument at about 
                    age 7, the sisters decided to form a power trio in 2013. 
                    They learned to play rock songs and posted videos of their 
                    performances to YouTube.
