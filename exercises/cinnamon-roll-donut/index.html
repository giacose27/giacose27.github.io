            I got the inspiration for this recipe from Krispy Kreme donuts 
            because they sell cinnamon rolls on their menu except they are made
            with exactly the same dough as their original classic donuts. 
            However, these are rolled and swirled with cinnamon sugar filling. 
            I knew I had to recreate it at home and even better so let’s get
            into it!
        </p>
        <h1>Preparing the Filling</h1>
        <p>
            Before diving into the dough, let’s get our filling ready. 
            In a small bowl, combine light brown sugar and cinnamon to taste. 
            The butter will not get mixed in – it will be spread on directly to
            the rolled-out dough. Set this aside for later use.

            <li>1/4 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <ol>
            <h4>PREPARE THE FILLING</h4>
            <li>
                In a small bowl, mix together brown sugar and cinnamon. 
                Set aside.
            </li>
            <h4>MAKE THE DOUGH</h4>
            <li>
                To a large mixing bowl, add the warm milk, and instant yeast. 
                Whisk together until dissolved.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Then add the sugar, salt, egg, butter, and flour.</li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Combine together using a hook attachment and stand mixer or a 
                wooden spoon/rubber spatula. Knead the dough for about 3 to 4 
                minutes and then transfer to an oiled bowl.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Cover, and place in a warm place to rise about 
                1 hour to 1 hour and a half.
            </li>
            <h4>MAKE THE ICING</h4>
            <li>
                To a wide bowl, add the powdered sugar, whole milk, 
                and vanilla extract.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Whisk together very well until smooth and creamy.</li>
            <h4>SHAPE AND FRY</h4>
            <li>
                Once the dough has risen, flour a working surface and roll out 
                the dough with a rolling pin into a large rectangle until it is 
                about a little less than 1/2 an inch thick and 14 by 20 inches 
                in width and length.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Add the softened butter on top of the dough and use a rubber 
                spatula to spread the butter into an even layer across 
                the dough.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Sprinkle the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture over the butter
                and press it down firmly.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Roll it up tightly into a log and pinch the ends together very 
                tightly.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Cut the dough into about 3/4 inch slices to end up with about 
                16 to 18 pieces. Transfer each roll to an individual parchment 
                paper cut into a small square and place on a baking tray.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                ptional, for flatter donuts, smash each roll down a bit. For 
                thicker donuts, leave as is.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                over and allow it to proof again for about 45 minutes to an 
                hour.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Heat oil suitable for frying in a pot or deep pan like 
                vegetable, canola, or peanut oil. The perfect temperature 
                is around 325°F to 350°F.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Transfer 3 to 4 donuts into the hot oil, making sure not to 
                crowd them. Fry on each side until beautifully golden, flipping 
                over halfway.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Transfer to a wire rack to drain the excess oil.</li>
            <br>
            <li>
                If the icing has hardened, heat in the microwave for 15 to 30 
                seconds.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Dunk each donut in the icing, let any excess drip, and place it
                back on the wire rack to settle.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                After 5 minutes and the icing has hardened to the touch, 
                enjoy warm!
